### Art Therapy - Community Support Group Website
This website is for local communities nationwide. The purpose of this website is to advertise and provide information about our community support group program. The program is funded and provided completely free. The purpose of the program is to create a community spirit and promote a healthier lifestyle through art. We are particularly interested in people who feel isolated maybe through a lack of funds or resources, confidence, self-esteem or those who suffer from stress and anxiety. We want to bring local communities together around events based on a wide variety of artistic fields. There can be a divide along the lines of national, cultural and ethnic. This program hopes to bridge any divide that might exist through communication and freedom of expression through art, and each member can reap the health benefits through participation. There is a large study on the mental, physical and social health benefits of art. It is precisely this study that we want to utilize to bring different people together socially, creating a feeling of togetherness while nurturing the subtle seed of health.

The website is made up of twelve pages. There are three main parts to the website each part is made up of three pages. The first part covers the background, purpose and significance. The second covers the events and the third is a gallery of all the artworks produced by current members and participants. There is a landing page with a brief description and navigation links to the main content, a form page and a newsletter.
