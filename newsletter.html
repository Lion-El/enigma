                <p>
                    Mary and Anthony Jones, founders of an art events company
                    in the London borough of Bromley have received numerous 
                    local awards, and now they are set to receive national acclaim
                    for their contribution to the growth, development, health 
                    and wellbeing of local communities across London. 
                    Together Mary and Anthony created an art program to give 
                    rise to health and community spirit, focusing on community 
                    building by encouraging local communities especially those who 
                    feel marginalised and isolated to, share their culture experience 
                    and worldview through art. The aim is to help individuals
                    overcome mental health problems through the freedom of 
                    expression and self care, for local communities to engage 
                    in social activities and interaction through art. The ONS latest 
                    reports on mental health within the boroughs with which the 
                    couple's program is running has shown a huge fall in numbers; 
                    30% of mental health patients have safely transitioned back to 
                    health under their program. 20% are back in part time work and 
                    8% are back in full time work. Enigma are partnered with some local 
                    councils but now even major companies are now taking 
                    notice of the effect the couple's program is having on local 
                    members and are set to show their appreciation of the couple's 
                    program here's what they had to say:

                    "We absolutely love the work Enigma are doing. Mary and Anthony are 
                    real pillars of our community. When I met Mary and Anthony I was very 
                    impressed with their plans. At that time we were just recovering from Covid, 
                    lockdown restrictions and so as much as I liked their idea and plan we couldn't 
                    help or support them in anyway. Our staff had been cut, our budget had been cut, 
                    we were all overworked an under severe stress, but I was so impressed with them I 
                    was adamant we would support their cause as soon as we were able. They left my office 
                    undiscouraged and within a few months I found myself and many of my colleagues in their program. 
                    The work they have done and continue to do. continues to prove essential to the community" said 
                    Sir Robert Neil MP for Bromley and Chislehurst.

                    Sundar Pichai CEO of Google was astounded at the numbers released by the office of national 
                    statistics as it relates to the number of people that got back to work, over coming some the 
                    worst mental health conditions. He himself witnessed a large number of his own employees suffering 
                    from burn out, stress and depression, gradually all come back to work strong and healthy. he said 
                    "Working at Google can be very stressful particularly in software development and programming applications, 
                    so it is absolutely incredible what has been achieved. I will be reaching out to the founders of 
                    Enigma and seeing if we can work with them to launch their program here at Google".
